# **Application Programming Interface (API)**

Application Programming Interface, aka APIs, simplifies software development by securely allowing the applications to interact or exchange the data and functionalities.

## What is an API?

API is a messenger that takes the request from one system to another and returns the response.

It enables companies to share their applications&#39; data and functionalities with external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

## How an API works?

API acts as an intermediate layer between two applications. Here is how an API works:

1. One application initiates an API call to retrieve the information- known as &quot;Request.&quot;
2. After receiving a valid request, API makes a call to an external program or web server.
3. The server sends a response to API with the requested information.
4. The API transfers the data to the initial requested application.

All the above processes happen behind the GUI.

## Why do we need APIs?

It simplifies the process. API allows users to make the payment securely through third-party applications. As technology is developing rapidly, dependency on applications is also increasing.

API uses:

- Improves collaboration by enabling seamless communication between applications.
- Flexible by allowing new business partners to use services.
- Data security with API protocols.

## Types of APIs

Most of the API request and response happens through the internet.

| **Type** | **Alias** | **Authentication** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Open APIs** | Public APIs, or open-source APIs | Not required | Defined API endpoints, requests, and response formats |
| **Partner APIs** || Required login credentials from Partner APIs | Exposed to strategic business partners |
| **Internal APIs** | Private APIs | Required | Intend for internal users, hidden from external users |
| **Composite APIs** || Required | Allows users to request multiple endpoints in a single call |

# #API protocols

API protocols provide a set of rules to accepts the data exchange.

| **Protocol** | **Built** |
| --- | --- |
| **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** | XML (propriety) |
| **XML-RPC** | XML |
| **JSON-RPC** | JSON |
| **REST (Representational State Transfer)** | Web |

## Significance of API documentation

API docs are required to understand the possibilities of API and how to get started. For instance, X has created one API, Y wants to integrate this API into his application. Here X is the API developer, so they know API possibilities, functionalities, and protocols. Therefore, they must document all these functionalities so that Y will understand API integration.
