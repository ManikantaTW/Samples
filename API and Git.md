# **Application Programming Interface (API)**

Application Programming Interface, aka APIs, simplifies software development by securely allowing the applications to interact or exchange the data and functionalities.

# What is an API?

API is a messenger that takes the request from one system to another and returns the response.

It enables companies to share their applications&#39; data and functionalities with external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

# How an API works?

API acts as an intermediate layer between two applications. Here is how an API works:

1. One application initiates an API call to retrieve the information- known as &quot;Request.&quot;
2. After receiving a valid request, API makes a call to an external program or web server.
3. The server sends a response to API with the requested information.
4. The API transfers the data to the initial requested application.

All the above processes happen behind the GUI.

# Why do we need APIs?

It simplifies the process. API allows users to make the payment securely through third-party applications. As technology is developing rapidly, dependency on applications is also increasing.

API uses:

- Improves collaboration by enabling seamless communication between applications.
- Flexible by allowing new business partners to use services.
- Data security with API protocols.

# Types of API

Most of the API request and response happens through the internet.

| **Type** | **Alias** | **Authentication** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Open APIs** | Public APIs, or open-source APIs | Not required | Defined API endpoints, requests, and response formats |
| **Partner APIs** || Required login credentials from Partner APIs | Exposed to strategic business partners |
| **Internal APIs** | Private APIs | Required | Intend for internal users, hidden from external users |
| **Composite APIs** || Required | Allows users to request multiple endpoints in a single call |

# API protocols

API protocols provide a set of rules to accepts the data exchange.

| **Protocol** | **Built** |
| --- | --- |
| **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** | XML (propriety) |
| **XML-RPC** | XML |
| **JSON-RPC** | JSON |
| **REST (Representational State Transfer)** | Web |

# Significance of API documentation

API docs are required to understand the possibilities of API and how to get started. For instance, X has created one API, Y wants to integrate this API into his application. Here X is the API developer, so they know API possibilities, functionalities, and protocols. Therefore, they must document all these functionalities so that Y will understand API integration.

# **Git &amp; GitHub**

Git is an open-source and version controlling system. GitHub is a commercial platform that allows us to host files through Git.

# Git

Git helps software development by allowing multiple users to work on a single file.

- It is a version control system

- Terminal based application where user can enter commands

# GitHub

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service with GUI.

- Collaborate with the team from anywhere and accessing the unique URL provided by GitHub.
- Provides a Graphical User Interface

## Repositories

Repositories hold folders along with files. Users can create a repo through GitHub and clone it to a local system.

**Version control system**

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time to recall specific versions later.

# Git vs. GitHub

| **Git** | **GitHub** |
| --- | --- |
| Installed locally on the system | Hosted on the cloud |
| Works offline | Requires internet |
| Git works without GitHub | GitHub doesn&#39;t work without Git |
| Version control system | Centralized source code hosting |
| No GUI | GUI |

# Docs like code

Docs like code allow communication between developer and writer easier.

- Writing documents the same way as you write code.
- Documentation is in text format (HTML, XML, and MD).

# Git commands

| **Controls** | **Commands** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Un staging** | git clone | Create a working local repository |
|| git init | Create a new local repository |
| **Staging** | git add "file name", git add. | Add files to a staging |
| **Commit** | git status | Lists the files that need to commit |
|| git commit -m &quot;message.&quot; | Commit changes to head |
| **Push** | git push | Send changes to the working repository |

Note: Above commands are basic commands to perform simple operations through Git bash.

# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight mark-up language with plain text formatting. Its design allows it to convert into many different formats.
