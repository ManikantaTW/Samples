# Data Privacy on Online Platforms

## Overview

We are living in the Internet age; the internet is a basic need in our routine life. Technology is improving rapidly to fulfill our daily needs with a single click from our smartphones. We deny sharing our details such as name, phone number, residential address to strangers because we know those details are personal. But, during new application installation on our smartphones, do we ever spare time to read the privacy agreement?

## Data Privacy

Knowingly, or unknowingly we are generating tons and tons of data.

- Where is this data going?
- Who will access this data?
- What do they do with this data?

We never bother about it because we don&#39;t know what is happening behind us. Our privacy data is actually for sale on the internet. Companies will use this data for analytics; they will gather our private data such as age, location, and preferences. Your preferences will turn into a business advertisement on your same smartphone where you have shared the data. Who gave authority to these companies to use our data? Unfortunately, we are the ones who gave them this authority. Wondering in which way, we accept terms and conditions without reading them during the application installation.

As we accepted their conditions, we cannot legally challenge them. But this is a big concern not only to us but also for governments. Some countries impose strict laws on data privacy. Companies have to answer the government authorities on the usage of customer privacy data. They will impose high penalties on violations.

## Protect your privacy data

Before installing any application, make sure you read the terms and conditions, think twice before granting access to use your phone data. For already installed applications, go to settings\&gt;\&gt;Privacy settings\&gt;\&gt;turn off the application access to your phone. In this way, we can secure our private data.
